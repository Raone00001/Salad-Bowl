# Salad-Bowl Recipe Explanation

To create the Salad-Bowl Recipe, you must have all the ingredients from the list. Once you do, you can proceed to the process of making this salad. Process:

The very first thing that you should do, is make *a dressing*. You can do that by, first, using the ratio- **three parts oil to part vinegar**. If you want more flavour, you add chili flakes.

After that, you can cut all the greens into any size you want. Just make sure to not to make it *too* small. You can also cut the non-green ingredients, but that is *your choice*.

Add everything in the bowl.

Once that is done, you should season all the greens with a touch of *pepper* and *salt*. 

Then, add in your fresh herbs; which are the *cilantros* and *parslies*. You can as much as you want, but just make sure that you don't overdo it (unless you want it to be overdone).

Add the non-green ingredients with thw green ingredients.

Season it everything again, but less than last time.

Finally, add the dressing on the salad to give it flavour. Once you do that, you are done.

You can now serve/ eat the Salad-Bowl.
